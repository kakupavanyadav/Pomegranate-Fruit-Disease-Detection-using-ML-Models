# Pomegranate-Fruit-Disease-Detection-using-ML-Models
This study applies machine learning models (SVM, KNN, ANN, RF, 1-NN, FFNN) to detect pomegranate fruit diseases such as Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight, Cercospora, and Alternaria. Using preprocessing and feature extraction, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 94%, enabling early, precise, and automated disease detection.
